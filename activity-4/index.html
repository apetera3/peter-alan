                <p>This is hands down one of the best keyboards I've ever used! Beats my old beat up keyboard from 2003!</p>

                <p>Waste of money and over hyped! Razer has wayyyy better keyboards than this garbage and comes with better features! </p>

                <p>I really like the keyboard's features especially its gaming colors but I really wished it could've offered more keys. I'd give this a try but there's better options!</p>

                <p>I'm really glad logitech decided to add a student discount for this keyboard! Would highly recommend it for students who need new keyboards!</p>

                <p>Ehhhh, for a student discount they should've lowered the price more. I'm a broke college student and 60 bucks was a little too much for a simple keyboard in my opinion</p>
